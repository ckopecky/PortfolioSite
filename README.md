# PortfolioSite

This site started with going through portions the UX Design Process:  Definition, Ideation and Design. 

In my research I took a look at two portfolio sites of a website developer. And while in most cases, heuristics passed, there were things I noticed from a UX standpoint that could stand to be done better:  the mobile breakpoint and how that content is displayed to the user. 

__Definition__:

What is the minimum amount of information needed to get my overall point across? 

* Name
* What I do (or want to do)
* Projects
* Resume
* A way to contact me
* About Me

-- This is what will go in the mobile version. If this is the minimum, we can expand from here for tablet and desktop versions.
